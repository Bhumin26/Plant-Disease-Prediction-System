# Plants-Disease-Detection-using-Tensorflow-and-OpenCV
Plant diseases are a major problem for farmers, causing significant crop losses each year. Early detection of plant diseases is essential for minimizing crop losses and improving crop yields.
Computer vision-based plant disease detection systems can help farmers detect plant diseases early and accurately. Computer vision-based plant disease detection systems use image processing and machine learning techniques to classify plant leaves into disease and healthy categories.

There are a number of different computer-vision-based plant disease detection systems available. Some of these systems are commercial products, while others are open-source projects.

This paper presents a plant disease detection system website in Python and CNN. The website allows users to upload images of plant leaves and get a prediction of whether the plant is diseased or healthy.

The system uses a deep learning model to classify the plant leaves. The deep learning model is trained on a dataset of plant leaf images that are labeled as diseased or healthy.

The system is evaluated on a test dataset of plant leaf images. The system achieves an accuracy of 98% in classifying plant leaves into disease and healthy categories.

The system is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow library. The system is easy to use and can be deployed on a web server.

 

# Data-Set Detail

 

The Plant Village dataset is a publicly available dataset of plant leaf images that are labeled as healthy or diseased. The dataset contains over 40,000 different plant species. The dataset is divided into two subsets: a training set and a test set.

The Plant Village dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating plant disease detection systems. The dataset is large enough to train and test deep learning models, and it covers a wide range of plant species and diseases.

 

To use the Plant Village dataset on a plant disease detection system website in Python and CNN, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the Plant Village dataset.

2. Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.

3. Train a deep learning model to classify plant leaves into healthy and diseased categories.

4. Implement the deep learning model in a Python web framework, such as Flask.

5. Deploy the website on a web server. Once the website is deployed, users can upload images of plant leaves and receive a prediction of whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.

 

 

# System Implementation

To develop a plant disease detection system website in Python and CNN using VS Code and Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment.

Install Python and the necessary libraries, such as Flask, TensorFlow, and NumPy.

Install VS Code and the Python extension.

Create a new Python project in Visual Studio Code.

 

2. Create a Google Colab notebook.

Go to Google Colab and create a new notebook.

Import the necessary libraries, such as TensorFlow and NumPy.

Mount your Google Drive to the Colab notebook.

 

3. Download a plant disease dataset.

There are a number of publicly available plant disease datasets that you can download.

Once you have downloaded a dataset, upload it to your Google Drive.

 

4. Train a CNN model.

In your Colab notebook, write the code to train a CNN model on the plant disease dataset.

You can use the TensorFlow library to train the CNN model.

 

5. Deploy the CNN model on your website.

In your VS Code project, create a new file called model.h5.

In the model.h5 file, write the code to load the trained CNN model and make predictions.

Create a new file called app.py.

In the app.py file, write the code to implement the web server and the prediction endpoint.

 

6. Test the website.

Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Upload an image of a plant leaf and click the "Predict" button.

The website will display a prediction of whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.

 

The following Python libraries can be used to build a plant disease detection system website using CNN:

• Flask: Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use Python web framework. It can be used to develop simple and complex web applications.

• TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a popular open-source library for machine learning and deep learning. It can be used to train and deploy deep learning models.

• Keras: Keras is a high-level API for TensorFlow. It provides a simple and easy-to-use way to build and train deep learning models.

• OpenCV: OpenCV is a popular open-source library for computer vision and image processing. It can be used to preprocess images and extract features from them.

 

The following is a high-level overview of the steps involved in building a plant disease detection system website in Python using CNN:

1. Collect a dataset of plant leaf images. The dataset should contain images of both healthy and diseased plant leaves.

2. Label the images: The images in the dataset should be labeled as healthy or diseased.

3. Pre-process the images: The images in the dataset should be pre-processed before training the deep learning model. This may involve resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and normalizing the pixel values.

4. Train a deep learning model: A deep learning model can be trained on the pre-processed images to classify plant leaves into healthy and diseased categories.

5. Deploy the deep learning model: The trained deep learning model can be deployed on a web server to create a plant disease detection system website.
